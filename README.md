## Enable Copilot coding agent on your repository

Before we can start delegating requests to Copilot, we need to grant access to our repository.

1. In the top right, click your **user icon** and select **Settings**.

1. In the left navigation, expand the **Copilot** section and select **Coding agent**.

1. The **Repository access** field should either have All repositories or `Only selected repositories` and ensure the new repository is selected.

## Explore Copilot coding agent settings in your repository

To check the Copilot coding agent settings for your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Settings** in the repository menu.
3. In the left sidebar, find and select the **Copilot** section.
4. Click on **Coding agent**.
5. Explore the **Internet access**settings. This is the place where the Copilot's access to internet can be restricted. [More information](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall)

This ensures the Copilot coding agent is properly configured for your repository.
